# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing comprehensive unit tests for the Ticket Creation and AI Triage feature. The testing implementation will cover 8 core functions with 61 test cases across positive, negative, edge, and error scenarios to ensure robust functionality and reliability of the ticket management system.

## Glossary

- **TicketService**: Service class responsible for ticket creation, AI triage integration, and data validation
- **UnifiedTicketCreation**: React component handling the ticket creation user interface
- **AI_Triage_Functions**: Collection of functions handling AI-powered ticket analysis and suggestions
- **Test_Framework**: Vitest testing framework for unit test execution
- **Mock_Objects**: Simulated dependencies for isolated testing
- **Coverage_Report**: Metrics showing test coverage across different scenarios

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive unit tests for the TicketService class, so that I can ensure reliable ticket creation and AI integration functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN TicketService.createTicket() is called with valid data, THE Test_Framework SHALL verify successful ticket creation with AI suggestions
2. WHEN TicketService.createTicket() is called with invalid data, THE Test_Framework SHALL verify appropriate error handling and validation messages
3. WHEN TicketService.getAITriageSuggestions() is called, THE Test_Framework SHALL verify AI service integration and response handling
4. WHEN TicketService.validateTicketData() is called, THE Test_Framework SHALL verify comprehensive data validation logic
5. WHERE AI service is unavailable, THE Test_Framework SHALL verify graceful degradation behavior

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want unit tests for the UnifiedTicketCreation component, so that I can ensure proper form handling and user interaction behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN UnifiedTicketCreation.handleSubmit() is called with valid form data, THE Test_Framework SHALL verify successful form submission
2. WHEN UnifiedTicketCreation.handleSubmit() is called with invalid form data, THE Test_Framework SHALL verify proper validation error display
3. WHILE form validation is active, THE Test_Framework SHALL verify real-time validation feedback
4. IF authentication expires during submission, THEN THE Test_Framework SHALL verify proper error handling and redirect behavior
5. WHERE AI suggestions are available, THE Test_Framework SHALL verify suggestion integration in the UI

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want unit tests for AI triage functions, so that I can ensure reliable AI integration and response processing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN validateInput() is called with valid triage request, THE Test_Framework SHALL verify proper input validation
2. WHEN callGeminiAI() is called with valid parameters, THE Test_Framework SHALL verify API communication and response handling
3. WHEN createPrompt() is called with ticket data, THE Test_Framework SHALL verify proper prompt generation
4. WHEN parseTypeAndPriority() is called with AI response, THE Test_Framework SHALL verify accurate parsing and fallback logic
5. IF API rate limits are exceeded, THEN THE Test_Framework SHALL verify appropriate error handling

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive test coverage across all scenarios, so that I can ensure system reliability under various conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Test_Framework SHALL execute 17 positive test cases covering standard functionality
2. THE Test_Framework SHALL execute 18 negative test cases covering invalid inputs and error conditions
3. THE Test_Framework SHALL execute 14 edge test cases covering boundary conditions and special scenarios
4. THE Test_Framework SHALL execute 12 error test cases covering system failures and exception handling
5. THE Test_Framework SHALL generate coverage reports showing test distribution across scenario types

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper test infrastructure and mocking setup, so that I can run tests in isolation without external dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Test_Framework SHALL provide mock implementations for Supabase database operations
2. THE Test_Framework SHALL provide mock implementations for Gemini AI API calls
3. THE Test_Framework SHALL provide mock implementations for authentication services
4. THE Test_Framework SHALL support test data fixtures for consistent test scenarios
5. WHERE external services are mocked, THE Test_Framework SHALL verify mock behavior matches expected interfaces
