# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables instructors to optionally save their ticket responses as knowledge base entries. When students create new tickets, the system automatically searches the knowledge base and suggests relevant answers from previously answered questions by instructors. This creates a self-service knowledge repository that reduces repetitive questions and improves response efficiency.

## Glossary

- **Knowledge Base System**: The component responsible for storing, indexing, and retrieving instructor answers
- **Instructor**: A user with teaching privileges who can answer student tickets and save responses to the knowledge base
- **Student**: A user who creates tickets with questions
- **Ticket**: A support request or question submitted by a student
- **Knowledge Entry**: A stored answer from an instructor that includes the original question context and response
- **Auto-Suggestion Engine**: The component that matches new ticket questions with existing knowledge entries
- **Save Option**: A user interface control that allows instructors to choose whether to save their answer to the knowledge base

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Knowledge Base Entry Creation

**User Story:** As an instructor, I want to optionally save my ticket responses to a knowledge base, so that similar questions can be automatically answered in the future

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an Instructor submits a response to a Ticket, THE Knowledge Base System SHALL display a Save Option to add the response to the knowledge base
2. WHERE the Instructor selects the Save Option, THE Knowledge Base System SHALL create a Knowledge Entry containing the question text, answer text, instructor identifier, and timestamp
3. THE Knowledge Base System SHALL allow the Instructor to edit the Knowledge Entry content before saving
4. WHEN the Instructor confirms saving, THE Knowledge Base System SHALL store the Knowledge Entry with searchable metadata including topic tags and keywords
5. THE Knowledge Base System SHALL provide feedback confirmation within 2 seconds after the Knowledge Entry is successfully saved

### Requirement 2: Automatic Answer Suggestion

**User Story:** As a student, I want to receive automatic answer suggestions when I create a ticket, so that I can get immediate help without waiting for an instructor

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Student creates a new Ticket, THE Auto-Suggestion Engine SHALL analyze the question text for semantic similarity with existing Knowledge Entries
2. IF the Auto-Suggestion Engine finds Knowledge Entries with similarity score above 70 percent, THEN THE Knowledge Base System SHALL display the top 3 most relevant suggestions to the Student
3. THE Knowledge Base System SHALL display each suggestion with the original question, answer preview, and instructor name who provided the answer
4. THE Knowledge Base System SHALL allow the Student to view the complete Knowledge Entry details
5. THE Knowledge Base System SHALL complete the search and display suggestions within 3 seconds of ticket creation

### Requirement 3: Knowledge Entry Management

**User Story:** As an instructor, I want to manage my saved knowledge entries, so that I can keep the knowledge base accurate and up-to-date

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Knowledge Base System SHALL provide an interface where Instructors can view all Knowledge Entries they have created
2. THE Knowledge Base System SHALL allow Instructors to edit the content of their own Knowledge Entries
3. THE Knowledge Base System SHALL allow Instructors to delete their own Knowledge Entries
4. WHEN an Instructor modifies a Knowledge Entry, THE Knowledge Base System SHALL update the last-modified timestamp
5. THE Knowledge Base System SHALL maintain a version history showing the original and modified content for each Knowledge Entry

### Requirement 4: Student Feedback on Suggestions

**User Story:** As a student, I want to indicate whether suggested answers were helpful, so that the system can improve suggestion accuracy over time

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Knowledge Base System SHALL display feedback controls (helpful or not helpful) for each suggested Knowledge Entry
2. WHEN a Student marks a suggestion as helpful, THE Knowledge Base System SHALL record the positive feedback and associate it with the Knowledge Entry
3. WHEN a Student marks a suggestion as not helpful, THE Knowledge Base System SHALL record the negative feedback
4. THE Auto-Suggestion Engine SHALL use feedback scores to adjust future suggestion rankings
5. THE Knowledge Base System SHALL display the helpfulness rating (percentage of positive feedback) for each Knowledge Entry to Instructors

### Requirement 5: Privacy and Access Control

**User Story:** As an instructor, I want control over who can see my knowledge entries, so that I can manage the visibility of my responses

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a Knowledge Entry, THE Knowledge Base System SHALL allow the Instructor to set visibility as either public (all students) or course-specific
2. WHERE a Knowledge Entry is marked as course-specific, THE Auto-Suggestion Engine SHALL only suggest it to Students enrolled in that course
3. THE Knowledge Base System SHALL prevent Students from viewing Knowledge Entries they do not have permission to access
4. THE Knowledge Base System SHALL allow Instructors to change the visibility settings of their Knowledge Entries at any time
5. THE Knowledge Base System SHALL display the current visibility status clearly when Instructors view their Knowledge Entries
